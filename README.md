# style-twitter-bot

ðŸŒƒ Reimagine any image in the style of Van Gogh's _The Starry Night_! ðŸŒ•

This is a twitterbot that performs the following steps in order once initialized:
    
    - listen for tweets targeted at a given twitter account
    - pull the image from the tweet 
    - perform neural style transfer on the input image
    - reply to the tweeter with the output image in a reply tweet (also saves output to local disk)

## Examples
Here are examples from my own bot, implemented with this code as-is. To see more examples, you can visit the bot [@StarryNightBot](https://twitter.com/starrynightbot). 

*note* Due to recent changes in the Twitter dev API ðŸ˜ž, my bot is no longer live, so tweets to it won't return anything. Sorry!
